    "The purpose of this project is to perform an exploratory analysis on rankings of global universities that can provide applicants a guideline in many different aspects to help them make better decisions on their applications. The project will also strive to suggest improvements in the areas covered by the ranking systems to make them stronger. However, often ranking a university is a difficult and controversial practice due to many influences, including geographical coverage, institutional coverage, the way indicators are calculated, etc. From what I’ve learned from human-centered data science so far, I would like to take bias into consideration. Therefore, two global university rankings from very different places will be used to find out underlying biases among ranking systems produced by different countries. The project should be fully reproducible by following the step-by-step instructions in the final notebook file."

    "More than 4.5 million students are enrolled in university-level education outside their country of origin and this number is continually growing. Over the past years, as a new form of higher education evaluation system, university ranking has become prevalence all over the world. World university rankings are widely used to measure the competitiveness of instructing institutions and regarded as one of crucial factors to consider for applicants of overseas universities. From the perspective of schools, it is important to know which objective indicators have the largest impact on their rankings so that they can improve practices and ranks to raise their reputations. On the other hand, it is also important for the people who are seeking for universities abroad to know which countries have most high-quality universities so that they can have a clearer direction on their applications.

    "In order to answer the research questions and test hypotheses, I plan to perform a couple of quantitative analyses and visualize data on the datasets from two of the most influential and widely observed university measures. In addition, other two datasets, population data and school and country lookup table, will be specific to some of hypotheses. Population dataset is downloaded from the Population Research Bureau website. Others are from Kaggle website. All datasets are public and can be legally used without constraints. Since the population data is from a certain year and there are plenty of missing values in the data of low-ranking universities in both ranking datasets, I plan to perform analysis on top 200 globally ranked universities in 2015."
